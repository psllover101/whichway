Hence it would not be necessary to bring it under public control,
if the state did not require deeper teaching and insight, and expect
science to satisfy the need. Yet this shallowness, notwithstanding its
seeming innocence, does bear upon social life, right and duty
generally, advancing principles which are the very essence of
superficiality. These, as we have learned so decidedly from Plato, are
the principles of the Sophists, according to which the basis of right is
subjective aims and opinions, subjective feeling and private
conviction. The result of such principles is quite as much the
destruction of the ethical system, of the upright conscience, of love
and right, in private persons, as of public order and the institutions of
the state. The significance of these facts for the authorities will not be
obscured by the claim that the bolder of these perilous doctrines
should be trusted, or by the immunity of office.
